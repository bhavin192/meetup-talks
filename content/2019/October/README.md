## A Very basic Python Virtual Machine which executes Python byte code
  * **Speaker**: Shinto C V
  * **Description**: Shinto demonstrates his project, which is a toy
    python-virtual-machine. It takes a Python bytecode and executes
    it. He shows how Python bytecode looks like and an intermediate
    assembly like code generated from that bytecode for easy
    understanding.

## Removing Named Entities for Legal Querying
  * **Speaker**: Ravina More
  * **Description**: In this talk, Ravina demonstrates the approach
    that she used to remove named entities from a legal query to
    improve the legal extraction. This helps to find a resolved legal
    case that is similar to your case, which is important as well as
    difficult to achieve even when you have sufficient amount of
    historical data.
